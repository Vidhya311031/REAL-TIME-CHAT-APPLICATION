##I developed a Real-Time Chat Application using WebSockets along with a modern front-end framework (React.js / Vue.js) to provide an interactive and seamless communication experience. The core objective of this project was to enable instant message delivery without page reloads, ensuring a fast and engaging user experience. The application features a responsive and intuitive chat interface that adapts to different screen sizes, making it accessible across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

To enhance usability, I implemented message history, allowing users to view past conversations and maintain continuity in communication. The project is designed with a scalable architecture, making it easier to extend with advanced features such as user authentication, private/group chats, media sharing, typing indicators, and push notifications.Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with real-time web technologies, state management, responsive UI design, and event-driven programming. This application not only serves as a functional chat platform but also as a foundation for building enterprise-grade real-time communication systems.
